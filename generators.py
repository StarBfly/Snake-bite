#Tuples are typically used to contain a heterogeneous sequence of values, such that the tuple represents one object: a person,
#  a building, a country, etc. So one use case would be reading a row from a database into a tuple. Not even speaking about
# NamedTuple

character = ("Aloy", "Nora", 19, True)

from collections import namedtuple

character_nt = namedtuple("character", "name" "tribe" "age" "hunt")

#Whereas lists are typically homogeneousâ€“a series of the same type of thing: names, numbers, etc
